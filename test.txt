"  What is Covid-19 – the illness that started in Wuhan?  It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.   What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?  The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.   Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?

"  Food insecurity affects more than 11 million children in the US alone . For these kids, often times the only meals they receive daily are those they receive from free and reduced lunch programs through their schools. With the Coronavirus causing havoc across the world and becoming an increasing issue in the United States, many schools are closing in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Because of this, children may be left without that critical lifeline to healthy meals. A few members of the Missouri Students Association’s Social Justice Committee* are raising money in order to support both local Columbia food banks and the national charity No Kid Hungry, that works to ensure healthy meals are provided to children in food insecure homes. All money donated will be split 50-50 and be donated to both of these programs. We thank you for your generosity in advance! "

This post is targeted to all my friends and fellows in US. Due to recent increase of COVID19 cases in Pakistan and lockdowns a lot of daily wage earners and labourers have been affected and situation is going to get worse overtime.
"To provide Ration to these people, a lot of people are working on voluntarily basis. A few of them i know personally and could vouch for their integrity and trustworthiness."
I have attached links to their food drives as well in the end.
This is the time we need to step up as a community and help others.
"Being abroad, i thinks we should donate generously and pray for humanity."
May we get rid of this virus soon and may everything get back to normal soon (Inshallah)

"These are the people and charities who will use these funds to distribute rations. If you want you may write a particular charity, else I will try to equally distribute among the below mentioned charities."

" Due to the Corona Virus, our staff members at The Geek Easy have been functionally unemployed until we re-open our doors in a matter of weeks/months.  We love our staff. We're worried for their well-being and know that this will be tremendous hardship for them and are trying to find any way to help through this difficult time. This money will help to pay our bartenders, bussers, security, etc rent and other bills during a time of crisis. I know many people who read this will have their own financial burdens so thankyou for considering donating. I  really don't like asking people for money on the internet, but I'll do anything to help my Geek Easy family.  With Love, Alex of The Geek Easy"
